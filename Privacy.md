Writease Privacy Policy

Collection and Use of User Information

There is no requirement to collect any personal information from users while using the Writease application. However, information provided by users (such as created petitions or scanned documents) is stored on their local devices and may be used within the application to provide services to the user.

Use of ChatGPT

Writease utilizes ChatGPT for its AI capabilities to assist users in drafting petitions. ChatGPT processes user inputs locally within the application and does not transmit any data to external servers.

Data Sharing

Writease does not share users' personal information with third parties. However, documents or information provided by users may be disclosed if required by law or in response to valid legal requests.

Security

Writease takes reasonable measures to protect the security of users' information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while Writease strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect users' information, it cannot guarantee its absolute security.
